‘Music is everyone’s possession. It’s only publishers that think people own it.’ - John Lennon  

I wasn't sure how to welcome you to my website so I went to one of the greatest that ever lived and thought I’d start with words that has always inspired me. 

See I’m not just a musician but also a fan.

Music unifies people, cultures and all races across this crazy world and being apart of it and having a voice is an honour that I will forever be grateful for. 

I start this journey with you and wherever it may lead I will always stay true to my first and one true love, music.

So welcome to my life and words.
